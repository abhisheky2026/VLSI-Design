 In this report document, the work done during the summer internship was mainly on Hardware 
Description languages. Although my summer training program has a motive to be able to design 
the Hardware that has efficient performance and operation. In this project report, I have included 
various  concepts  used  in  the  VLSI  designing  using  Verilog  .  Different  modelling  styles  have 
different parameters, assignments (blocking and non-blocking), proper instantiation of code and 
correct use of blocks (initial and final block) within the code report also includes the details  of 
the Institution from where I did my summer training. In addition  to this a project was allotted at 
the last which was the most interesting task  of this internship. 
I have tried my best to conclude each and every thing in this report which I had learned during 
this summer training of six weeks.
